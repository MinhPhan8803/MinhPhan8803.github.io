I'm a first year CS PhD student at UT Austin, advised by Prof. [Vijay Chidambaram](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vijay). My research interests lie in the intersection of systems and (memory-safe) programming languages.

Previously I was a BSc in CS student at UIUC where I worked in Prof. [Tianyin Xu's](https://tianyin.github.io) xLab.
